    "## Infectious diseases - The SIR model\n",
    "A popular model for the spread of infectious diseases was proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in 3 articles starting in 1927. It is actually one of the models that has been used to predict the spread of COVID-19 over the last two years. In the simplest case, the model breaks up an isolated population into 3 groups: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Removed (R). Those in the Susceptible group (those who are not sick, but can get sick) can be infected by coming into contact with someone in the Infected group (those that are currently sick) with rate $\\alpha$. Those in the Infected group can either recover or die with rate $\\beta$. They are then put into the Removed group.\n",
    "For a fixed population of $N$ people, this is described by the following system of (non-linear!) ordinary differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} &= -\\alpha(t)  S(t) I(t),\\\\ \n",
    "\\frac{dI(t)}{dt} &= \\alpha(t)  S(t) I(t) - \\beta I(t),\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dR(t)}{dt} &= \\beta I(t) \\\\\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio of the rates $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is used to define the reproduction number $R_{0}$, which is the average number of people a person will infect over the course of their disease:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "R_{0} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $R_{0} = 2$ means that, on average, someone who is sick will infect two more people over the course of their disease. Those two people can in turn infect two more, and so on. Roughly speaking, if $R_{0}> 1$, the infection rate is greater than the removal rate and the infection will spread in the population. If $R_{0} < 1$, the infection will die out before it can spread by any significant amount, since people will on average recover (or die - but we'll assume that everyone recovers) faster than they can infect others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that a strong assumption in this model is that the population is isolated. This means that no one can leave or enter the population. In particular, this means that for a population with $N$ people, $S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N$  at all points in time."

    "The reproduction number is a difficult number to estimate, but we will assume it currently has a value of $R_{0} \\approx 1.2$. We'll take the incubation time of COVID-19 to be 14 days, meaning $\\beta = 1/14 \\textrm{ day}^{-1} \\approx 0.071 \\textrm{ day}^{-1}$. This makes $\\alpha = R_{0}\\beta \\approx 0.0857 \\textrm{ day}^{-1}$. For simplicity, we will look at the CPS department in UTM as an isolated community. Suppose there are 500 students in total in the CPS department ($N = 500$). Unbeknownst to everyone, there is one student who is sick ($I(t = 0) = 1$), leaving $S(t = 0) = 499$ students susceptible. \n",

We'll take the initial number of recovered students to be $R(t = 0) = 0$.\n",

For example, people move across cities, provinces and countries. Each of these places may have a different $R_{0}$. There is also evidence showing that certain members of the population are more susceptible to being infected. We have not taken this into account. There are many more complications that need to be taken into account when building this model. We didn't have to worry about measuring rates, which in practice, relies on imperfect testing, reporting and tracing. These are some of the things (there are many more) that make the problem of predicting the course of an outbreak so difficult.
